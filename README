ParElag is a parallel distributed memory C++ library
for numerical upscaling of finite element discretizations.

For building instructions, see the file INSTALL. Copyright information and
licensing restrictions can be found in the file COPYRIGHT and LICENSE.

ParElag implements upscaling and algebraic multigrid techniques for the efficient
solution of the algebraic linear system arising from mixed finite element
discretization of saddle point problems.
In particular, it constructs upscaled discretization for wide classes of
partial differential equations and unstructured meshes in an element-based
algebraic multigrid framework. This approach has the potential to be more
accurate than classical upscaling techniques based on piecewise polynomial
approximation. In fact, the coarse spaces and respective coarse models computed
by ParElag not only posses the same stability and approximation properties of the
original finite element discretization but also are operator dependent.

ParElag uses the MFEM library (http://mfem.org) for the finite element
discretization and supports several solvers from the HYPRE library.
Visualization in ParElag is based on GLvis (http://glvis.org).

For examples of using ParElag, see the examples/ directory.
