The ParElag requires a MPI C++ compiler, as well as the
following external libraries:

- BLAS (http://www.netlib.org/blas/)
- LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/)
- MFEM v3.0 (http://mfem.googlecode.com/)
- METIS v5.1 (http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview)
- HYPRE v2.10.0b (http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/hypre)
- SuiteSparse v4.2 (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/)

The OpenGL visualization tool GLvis (www.glvis.googlecode.com) is required to
visualize the results.

Building with 'gmake'
=====================
The build system of ParELAG uses GNUMakefile.
It allows to specify the path to the required software or to automatically download and build dependencies (if an internet connection is available).

Compilers and paths to ParELAG's dependencies can be specified by generating and editing the Makefile.in.

NOTE:
    a) One can edit the Makefile.in by providing the absolute path to some of the ELAG dependencies.
       If some paths are set to MISSING, the missing dependency will be automatically downloaded and build.
    b) OpenMP support is still experimental and therefore one should not be used.
    c) MFEM needs to be build with MPI, METIS_5, SUITESPARSE, and LAPACK support enabled. 

Some of the available 'make' targets are:

make              -> Builds the libelag.a library.
make debug        -> Builds the libelag.a library in debug mode.
make deps-install -> Downloads and compiles BLAS, LAPACK, METIS_5, HYPRE, SuiteSparse, and MFEM.
make doc          -> Builds the documentation
make clean        -> Cleans the build of libelag.a and the examples

Examples
========

To compile and run the examples execute "make" (optimize mode) or "make debug" (debug mode) in the examples folder.
If an example is executed without command line arguments the default settings will be used.
