/** \class Hierarchy
 *  \brief This manages multigrid cycles using pre-defined operators.
 *
 *  This is essentially geometric multigrid; all pieces are expected
 *  to exist prior to creating this object. There is no mechanism in
 *  place for building missing operators on-the-fly (though it would
 *  be possible to add this, if needed). The operators used by this
 *  class are only expected to have an Op-Vec multiply defined (i.e.,
 *  they satisfy mfem::Operator). The operators that are needed are as
 *  follows:
 *
 *     * A (needed on every level): system operator for given level.
 *
 *     * P (needed on every level but the finest): interpolation
 *       operator from level to finer.
 *
 *     * R (needed on every level but the coarsest): restriction
 *       operator from level to coarser.
 *
 *     * Pre-Smoother (any levels): PreSmoothing operator. May be
 *       null.
 *
 *     * Post-Smoother (any levels): PostSmoothing operator. May be
 *       null.
 *
 *     * Coarse Solver (coarsest level): Solver to be called on
 *       coarsest grid system.
 *
 *  A note on these objects. The paradigm is this:
 *
 *     * The only functionality required of any of these operators is
 *       a Operator-Vector product. (Also possibly required is an
 *       Operator-Transposed-Vector product, see rules for \f$P\f$ and
 *       \f$R\f$ below.)
 *
 *     * A consequence of this is that Galerkin coarse-grid operators,
 *       \f$A_c=RAP\f$, cannot be computed on-the-fly. Therefore,
 *       coarse-grid operators must be constructed before Mult() is
 *       called.
 *
 *     * If \f$P\f$ does not exist or is null but \f$R\f$ exists and
 *       is not null, \f$P=R^T\f$ is used.
 *
 *     * If \f$R\f$ does not exist or is null, \f$R=P^T\f$ is used.
 *
 *     * If at least one of \f$P\f$ and \f$R\f$ does not exist or is
 *       not null, an exception is thrown.
 *
 *     * Due to the above rules, if \f$P\f$ is set on the finest level
 *       but \f$R\f$ is missing or null, \f$R=P^T\f$ will be used for
 *       consistency. Likewise, if \f$R\f$ is set on the coarsest
 *       level but \f$P\f$ is missing or null, \f$P=R^T\f$ will be
 *       used.
 *
 *     * If the Pre-Smoother doesn't exist or is null, then there is
 *       no pre-smoothing.
 *
 *     * If the Post-Smoother doesn't exist or is null, then there is
 *       no post-smoothing.
 *
 *     * If, on the coarsest level, CoarseSolver does not exist or is
 *       null, then the PreSmoother (if any) is called, followed by
 *       the PostSmoother (if any). If a CoarseSolver is found, no
 *       smoothers are searched for.
 *
 *     * If, on the coarsest level, none of CoarseSolver, PreSmoother,
 *       and PostSmoother are valid, nothing will happen on that level
 *       and a correction of zero will be interpolated to next finer
 *       level. This has no significance and is the result of the
 *       above rules.
 *
 *     * The CoarseSolver is only checked on the coarsest level;
 *       setting it on any other level has no effect.
 *
 *  This class can currently handle "\f$\mu\f$-cycles", where
 *  \f$\mu=0\f$ corresponds to a V-cycle and \f$\mu=1\f$ to a
 *  W-cycle.
 *
 *  \todo There are plans to extend to a so-called k-cycle, in which
 *  the cycle can be changed on a per-level basis. Additionally, there
 *  are plans to extend to full multigrid.
 *
 *  \todo Cleanup memory usage, re auxiliary vectors.
