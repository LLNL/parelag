==================================================
Configuring with "cmake":
==================================================

CMake can be used to generate the build system for ParELAG. We require
version 2.8.11 or newer (though this is largely arbitrarily set as the
minimum version that I found on local machines).

*PLEASE* DO NOT DO AN IN-SOURCE BUILD! This will overwrite the legacy
Makefile system that has been left intact for the time being;
moreover, it will pollute your source tree with various files
generated and used by CMake. It is best practice to create a build
directory, even <parelag-root>/build is fine, and invoke CMake from
there.

The CMake system maintains an infrastructure to find and properly link
the required libraries when building the ParELAG library (see the
"Dependencies" section below for a complete list of the required and
optional libraries).

Some important flags/options are (defaults are in [brackets]):

  -- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={[None],Debug,Release,RelWithDebInfo,MinSizeRel}

     As a legacy feature, ParELAG uses the preprocessor macro
     "ELAG_DEBUG" to enable certain runtime assertions. This macro is
     only defined when this is set to "Debug".

  -- ParElag_ENABLE_OPENMP:BOOL={ON,[OFF]}

     This sets the PARELAG_USE_OPENMP preprocessor macro and enables
     OpenMP. This feature is HIGHLY experimental and OUGHT NOT TO BE
     USED.

  -- ParElag_ENABLE_PARMETIS:BOOL={ON,[OFF]}

     This enables ParMETIS functionality. This is currently minimal;
     if the use of ParMETIS in the library grows, this may become a
     required dependency.

The cmake/example_scripts directory contains some shell-script
templates that provide guidance on invoking CMake. These are provided
as a merely as a suggestion for different ways to build ParELAG. While
a script provides a convenient way to repeat the same configuration
repeatedly, command-line invocations are certainly
fine. Alternatively, the "ccmake" GUI can be used to set variables
manually. Note that directories need not be set for dependencies that
are installed to "standard" locations (/usr, /usr/local and the like).

After CMake configures and generates successfully, change to your
build directory (the directory that is listed after "Build files have
been written to: " at the bottom of the CMake output) and invoke the
build system (i.e. call "make" or "ninja" or whatever). This should
build the library and the examples.

The installer has not been completed yet, and the "install" target is
not defined. This is in the works.

"make help" will output a list of targets. In the parelag root
directory, this list should be more-or-less manageable; in src/, it
will be terrible and ugly.


==================================================
Dependencies
==================================================

ParELAG requires the following:

- A C++ compiler
- An MPI implementation
- BLAS (http://www.netlib.org/blas/)
- LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/)
- METIS v5.1 (http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview)
- HYPRE v2.10.0b (http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/hypre)
- SuiteSparse v4.2 (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/)
- MFEM (http://mfem.org/)

NOTE: MFEM must be built with parallel support (requires MPI, HYPRE,
and METIS) and with SuiteSparse support.

ParELAG has optional support for:

- SuperLU (I use v5.1.1; I think v4.* should maybe be ok?)
    * If using SuperLU, you *MUST* disable SuperLU (or FEI) in Hypre
      (pass "--without-superlu" or "--without-fei" to hypre's
      configure script). Failure to do this will unleash several
      nightmarish compiler and then linker errors. You've been warned.
- ParMETIS v4.0.3
- GLvis, for visualization of results (http://glvis.org)
- MARS (https://bitbucket.org/zulianp/mars) [under development]
    A mesh refinement library (including adaptive local refinement) for meshes of
    simplexes of any dimension.


==================================================
Examples
==================================================

The examples in the examples/ directory build automatically. Calling
one without arguments uses default values.
